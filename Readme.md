// Weather Sprint 

// created a weather website based off a fimga template with api calling from open weather

// Peer Review: Jesus Salgado - Looks really good compared to the figma only slight changes needed to opacity but overall you did a spot on job.
    The API doesn't work at all and its already 3 pm so please try to get that done so you can get some functionality before the deadline
